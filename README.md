# What is this? 
This is my implmentation of classifcation task of Fashion MNIST dataset using PyTorch.

This is a simple network which within five epocs has achived 89% accuracy, this is because I used ``1cycle`` as a learning rate scheduler, it's mind blowing that without it 5 epochs only got 64.5% accuracy, that's is a whopping increase of about 25%.
